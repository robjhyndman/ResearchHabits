 \item  Donâ€™t just cite what other people say about citations.
 \item  Store accurate reference info from the start.

# Searching

## Google Scholar

 * Searching for papers
 * Use advanced search
 * Link GS to your reference manager
 * Track citations of key papers
 * Star papers for your own library
 * Check recommended articles
 * Check author profiles, especially highly cited authors
 * Create your own GS profile once you have (at least) one paper
 * Follow key authors in your area

## Semantic Scholar

\begin{alertblock}{Reproducible}
\begin{itemize}\tightlist
\item All data edits scripted
\item All analysis scripted

## Reproducibility

\begin{block}{}
Someone should be able to reproduce your thesis without having to guess what software you had installed, what versions, which files do what, etc.
\end{block}\vspace*{-0.2cm}\pause

 * Stay organized.
 * One system for doing this using R is to write your thesis in an Rmarkdown or Quarto file.
 * Track software versions

## Version control
\fontsize{13}{15}\sf

 * `thesis_v1`, `thesis_v2`, etc., is not adequate version control.
 * You need to track changes over time, have a *remote* repository, and be able to roll back as required.
 * Your repository should contain *everything* required to produce your thesis including computer code, references, writing.
 * Your repository should have an obvious structure and be fully documented.
 * **Github** solves these problems
 * Read "Happy git with R": `happygitwithr.com`

\placefig{13}{5.8}{width=1.5cm}{github-mark}
\placefig{11.5}{7.2}{width=4.2cm}{github}


## Version control with git

 * RStudio integrates with github, so version control built in.
 * But github can be used with *any* text-based language including Stata, Python, LaTeX, R, Rmarkdown, Quarto, markdown, etc.
 * Git allows you to:
     - track changes
     - experiment in branches
     - undo
 * Github provides:
    - backup and restore
    - synchronisation

<!-- ## Some rules for good graphics
\fontsize{14}{16}\sf

1. Design graphics to highlight comparisons you want the reader to make.
1. Choose scales to facilitate comparisons.
1. Use a sensible aspect ratio. width:height of about 1.6, unless axes are on the same scale.
1. Prepare graphics in final aspect ratio. Distorted fonts look awful.
1. Use vector graphics such as eps or pdf.
1. Clear labels and detailed captions.
1. Avoid cluttered legends.
1. Specify units.
1. Label axes.

## Writing an abstract
\fontsize{15}{19}\sf

 1. What did you do?
 2. Why did you do it? What question were you trying to answer?
 3. How did you do it? State your methods.
 4. What did you learn? State your major results.
 5. Why does it matter? Point out at least one significant implication.

## Writing an abstract

 * Should be a stand-alone summary. It is the only thing most people will read.
 * No references or citations.
 * Write in the past tense.
 * Be explicit, precise and concise.
 * Stick to a single paragraph.
 * Restrict background information to a sentence or two at most.
 * Make sure that your abstract is consistent with what you reported in the thesis.
 * Write the abstract last
