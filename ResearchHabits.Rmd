# Searching

## Google Scholar

 * Searching for papers
 * Use advanced search
 * Link GS to your reference manager
 * Track citations of key papers
 * Star papers for your own library
 * Check recommended articles
 * Check author profiles, especially highly cited authors
 * Create your own GS profile once you have (at least) one paper
 * Follow key authors in your area

\begin{itemize}\tightlist
\item Data edited in a spreadsheet
\item Click and point analysis

\begin{alertblock}{Reproducible}
\begin{itemize}\tightlist
\item All data edits scripted
\item All analysis scripted
\item Graphs and tables automatically pulled in to the thesis
\item Tables generated with scripts
\end{itemize}
\end{alertblock}
\end{textblock}

\placefig{8}{1.3}{width=4.8cm}{2g9914}


## Reproducibility

\begin{block}{}
Someone should be able to reproduce your thesis without having to guess what software you had installed, what versions, which files do what, etc.
\end{block}\vspace*{-0.2cm}\pause

 * Stay organized.
 * One system for doing this using R is to write your thesis in an Rmarkdown file.
 * Track software versions

## Version control

\full{live-dangerously}

## Version control
\fontsize{13}{15}\sf

 * `thesis_v1`, `thesis_v2`, etc., is not adequate version control.
 * You need to track changes over time, have a *remote* repository, and be able to roll back as required.
 * Your repository should contain *everything* required to produce your thesis including computer code, references, writing.
 * Your repository should have an obvious structure and be fully documented.
 * **Github** solves these problems
 * Read "Happy git with R": `happygitwithr.com`

\placefig{10.5}{7.5}{width=2.2cm}{github}

## Version control with git

 * RStudio integrates with github, so version control is built in.
 * But github can be used with *any* text-based language including Stata, Python, LaTeX, R, Rmarkdown, markdown, etc.
 * Git allows you to:
     - track changes
     - experiment in branches
     - undo
 * Github provides:
    - backup and restore
    - synchronisation

## Some rules for good graphics
\fontsize{14}{16}\sf

1. Design graphics to highlight comparisons you want the reader to make.
1. Choose scales to facilitate comparisons.
1. Use a sensible aspect ratio. width:height of about 1.6, unless axes are on the same scale.
1. Prepare graphics in final aspect ratio. Distorted fonts look awful.
1. Use vector graphics such as eps or pdf.
1. Clear labels and detailed captions.
1. Avoid cluttered legends.
1. Specify units.
1. Label axes.

## Plagiarism

 * Never plagiarise from other papers — not even sentence fragments. Use your own words.

## Words to avoid

 * Note that
 * Interestingly
 * It is interesting to note that
 * Obviously
 * It is clear that

 3. How did you do it? State your methods.
 4. What did you learn? State your major results.
 5. Why does it matter? Point out at least one significant implication.

 * Write in the past tense.
 * Be explicit, precise and concise.
 * Stick to a single paragraph.
 * Restrict background information to a sentence or two at most.
 * Make sure that your abstract is consistent with what you reported in the thesis.
 * Write the abstract last


## How to write a lot

\begin{textblock}{6.5}(0,1.4)
\begin{itemize}\itemsep=0cm\parskip=0.1cm
\item Block out a regular writing time (e.g., 1 hour every morning).
\item Write something every day.
\item Set a word or paragraph goal for each session.
\item Practice makes \st{perfect} better.
\item Writing clarifies thinking.
\item Build on a scaffold.
